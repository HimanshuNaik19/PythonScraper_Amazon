# PythonScraper_Amazon

1. I am searching for a “Car Cover” on OLX - using this URL olx.in/items/q-car-cover?isSearchCall=true; I need a python program that gives me the search results parameters - like title of the ad, description and price. Print the results in table format. Don’t bother about the image. Place the code in Github and share the link.

   instead of olx i have used amazon because the website was not responding to the code. hope you understand :) .

2. The following questions test your aptitude for interacting with databases. The questions are based off the following public SQL DB: docs.rfam.org/en/latest/database.html
a) How many types of tigers can be found in the taxonomy table of the dataset? What is the "ncbi_id" of the Sumatran Tiger? (hint: use the biological name of the tiger)
   - answer is the taxonomy file with query, please check it 
b) Find all the columns that can be used to connect the tables in the given database.
   - columns names are the file.
c) Which type of rice has the longest DNA sequence? (hint: use the rfamseq and the taxonomy tables)
   - query and answer is in the file.
d) We want to paginate a list of the family names and their longest DNA sequence lengths (in descending order of length) where only families that have DNA sequence lengths greater than 1,000,000 are included. Give a query that will return the 9th page when there are 15 results per page. (hint: we need the family accession ID, family name and the maximum length in the results)
   - answer is the provided screenshot check it.

3. This question is to test your aptitude for writing small shell scripts on Unix. You are given this URL amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt. Write a shell script that extracts the Scheme Name and Asset Value fields only and saves them in a tsv file. And ever wondered if this data should not be stored in JSON?
